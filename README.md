# IPL Data Analysis

This project analyzes Indian Premier League (IPL) data from 2008 to 2020. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The data used for this analysis includes:

1. **IPL Ball-by-Ball Data (2008-2020)**: Details of every ball bowled in IPL matches.
2. **IPL Matches Data (2008-2020)**: Information about each IPL match, including the teams, venue, winner, etc.

## Key Python Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading**:
   - The IPL data is loaded from two CSV files: one for match data and another for ball-by-ball data.

2. **Initial Data Inspection**:
   - The notebook starts by displaying the first few rows of the data and checking the columns and structure of the datasets.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Some key metrics calculated include:
     - Total matches played.
     - Number of venues where matches have been played.
     - Number of unique players and teams.
   
4. **Visualizations**:
   - Visual representations of the data are created, including bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to provide insights on player performance, team wins, etc.
